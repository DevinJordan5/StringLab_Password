# StringLab_Password

Imagine you have to write a Password / Username checker. You'll need to manage changing requirements (write lots of simple methods). 
* 8 - 15 characters in length, 
* letters are ok, 
* except you can't use a _ . 
* It must start with a letter,
* contains at least one number.
* upper case && lower case
* At least one special character
* Have the user enter the password twice to confirm it is typed correctly.

### Advanced Ideas (the +1)
* new password canâ€™t contain any of the same characters in the same position as the previous password
* what else?


Write this in a way that the requirements can change easily. Make sure you include a +1 for the bonus point.

Create a good method that calls your specific methods.
